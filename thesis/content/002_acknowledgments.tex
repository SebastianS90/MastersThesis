I want to thank Dr David Pearce of the School of Engineering and Computer Science at Victoria University of Wellington.
He provided me an excellent topic to work on and steered me in the right direction when I got stuck.
I very much appreciate our regular discussions on my work and current development of \whiley.
\\\\
I would also like to thank my examiner Prof. Dr. Arnd Poetzsch-Heffter of the Software Technology Group at University of Kaiserslautern for getting me known to David and for the help while planning my journey.
\\\\
I am grateful to all the nice people that I have met in New Zealand.
You made my stay there so far away from my homeland especially enjoyable.
And I would like to thank my parents and friends at home.
Your encouragement bridged such a big distance.
\\\\
Finally, I want to thank the German Academic Exchange Service for fundings as part of their PROMOS program, and IBM who supports the German national "Deutschlandstipendium" scholarship where I got fundings from in my earlier studies.
