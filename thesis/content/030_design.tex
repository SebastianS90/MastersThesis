\chapter{Design}\label{chapter:design}
The purpose of this thesis is to introduce lifetimes to the \whiley programming language.
In the following, we present the objective of introducing lifetimes and give a broad overview of our extensions regarding syntactical changes, a definition of lifetimes in \whiley, and a discussion about our design decisions.
The actual implementation is covered in the next chapter.

\myref{Section}{section:motivation} motivates the introduction of lifetimes, giving a major use case regarding memory management.
In \ref{section:syntax} we present our syntactical language extensions, providing formal definitions and example programs.
We define lifetimes and their semantics for \whiley in \ref{section:design-lifetimes}.
\myref{Section}{section:design-discussion} provides a discussion about alternative approaches and the rationale behind our design decisions.
We also elaborate the differences to the \rust programming language.
Afterwards, \myref{chapter}{chapter:implementation} provides a detailed view of the actual implementation for the concepts introduced here.
